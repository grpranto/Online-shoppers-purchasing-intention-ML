<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project
A machine Learning project which was a part of my Bachelor course `Data Mining` to predict the purchasing intention of online shoppers. Classical machine learning classifiers have been applied on [online shoppers purchasing intention kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/online-shoppers-purchasing-intention-dataset) that consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions. The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period. Later it was preprocessed where categorical data has been converted into numerical data using one-hot encoding. It increased the number of attributes in the dataset. 70% of the data have been taken for training purposes and the rest of the data have been used for testing. Among 4 classifiers, `Random Forest` performed better than other classifiers.

It consists of: 
* four classifiers: `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest`, `Na√Øve Bayes`, `SVM`
* evaluation/permormance metrics: `Accuracy`, `TPR`, `FPR`, `AUC`, `Recall`, `Precision`
